# Day 13 – Introduction to Machine Learning

Today I learned the foundations of machine learning:
- What ML is and why it's used
- Supervised learning vs. unsupervised learning
- The difference between regression and classification
- How ML models learn patterns from data

Key takeaway:
ML is about mapping inputs → outputs using data. Not rules, not programming — patterns.
